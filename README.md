Write-up: [https://kevingal.com/blog/beatles-and-you.html](https://kevingal.com/blog/beatles-and-you.html).

Here you'll find:

* Scraping code for the Billboard music charts and various lyrics websites (requests + BeautifulSoup4).
* A sort of database for song lyrics that keeps each song as a JSON file (see `storage.py`).
* A GUI for manually entering song lyrics / viewing the songs in the database (PySimpleGUI).
* And various snippets of code for doing text analysis / data visualisation based on the lyrics (nltk + matplotlib).

I haven't bothered to clean it up, but you might find something useful.
