### TODO
* Do Beatles analysis again. This time, different words. And find something to compare it with, make a bar chart. Possibility: take average length of Lennon-McCartney songs, batch regular English text into blocks of that size and check word frequency. Same for dialogue... and same for other songs.
* Download chart list, save to database.
* Scrape as many lyrics as possible & update database.
* Make interface for quickly finding song lyrics & downloading them. In the worst case, allow manual entry of lyrics.
